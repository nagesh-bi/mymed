# Medical Express
Hello all, I am Nagesh Bitra from R.V.R & J.C Engineering College, Guntur. 
This is my project submission for Future Ready Talent Internship.

## Industry:
Health

## Project Title:
Mymed

## Problem Statement/Opportunity:

 The ongoing pandemic, hospitals are experiencing a surge in patient numbers, leading to extended wait times for tests and treatments. The selection of appropriate medication for specific illnesses has also become more challenging and time-consuming, resulting in prolonged wait times for patients and customers. This waiting period not only impacts the customer's experience but also leads to time wastage. 

## Project Description/Solution:
- This medical system is designed to streamline hospital activities, allowing new patients to conveniently request appointments through the website.

- The website confirms appointments based on available slots with respective doctors, promptly notifying patients. Efficient software is crucial for managing hospital information effectively.
- This application simplifies recording and accessing patient information, improving organizational effectiveness and work quality. Efficiently managing key processes is vital for hospital success.
- Electronically entering patient details into the Hospital Management System ensures data security and speeds up information processing. It ensures accurate maintenance of patient appointment details.
- This system reduces bookkeeping tasks, minimizing human effort and increasing accuracy, especially during this pandemic. Booking appointments becomes easier for  doctors and patients, and patients can also provide feedback.
- The website offers various services such as Free Checkups, 24/7 Ambulance services, Bed Facilities, and more, enhancing overall patient experience and hospital efficiency.
