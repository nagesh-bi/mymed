## Problem Statement/Opportunity:

 The ongoing pandemic, hospitals are experiencing a surge in patient numbers, leading to extended wait times for tests and treatments. The selection of appropriate medication for specific illnesses has also become more challenging and time-consuming, resulting in prolonged wait times for patients and customers. This waiting period not only impacts the customer's experience but also leads to time wastage.
